/*
    There are some people in a meeting hall, everyone is wearing a t-shirt in which a number is written on his t-shirt. we asked some of these people how many people other than themselves are wearing a t-shirt with the same number. in array asked, asked[i] means from ith person has been asked and that person gave answer for that.

    Given the array, return the mininum number of people in meeting hall.
    example-1: input: asked = [1,4,1], output: 7 explaination: 2 person said 1that can have same number lets say 0 t-shirt number. one person said 4 soin total 7 people (minimum) would be in hall.
    Example-2: input: asked = [30,30,30], output = 31
    constraints: 1 <= asked.length <= 5*10^4 0 <= asked[i] < 10^4
